## Abstract
This Take-Home-Challenge was an 8 hour sprint to test my React Fundementals on meeting MVP for an application within a time constrain. 
Using mock data to build an application that displays News Articles on load for the user to click and view as well as search through. 
Trending topics being the sourced data of articles the user can search through from the News [API data](https://newsapi.org/) provided.
